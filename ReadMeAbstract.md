# Abstract of the project:
     This project was done in my academic Internship in Great four systems Pvt Ltd, this company is a start-up with around 30 employees who work on a web application called Harmony. The main functionality of the Harmony is to provide features which are used in an, end to end labelling process of pharmaceutical drugs. This application is completely configurable and can be customized with respective to the client requirement.
                  My task was to automate the application end to end which works with different clients. I have used selenium java web driver and core java concepts like oops and have also used JDBC to work with dynamic web elements which change for each client. I have also created a simple UI using java swings for this Automation project, which provides an option for the user to test only a specific feature of the application. 
                            This Automation project directly fetches the values from an excel file and runs each test case till the entire test suite is completed. The UI of this Automation application provides each of these test cases as options. In order to perform unit testing when a new feature is added to the application by the development team.
